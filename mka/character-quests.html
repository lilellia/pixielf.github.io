<p>As Vayne walks through the workshop hallway, he hears an explosion coming from the workshop. After a short conversation, he and Philo gather new equipment from &lt;Someone's Workshop&gt; and dispose of the trash in the incinerator on the &lt;Campus Grounds&gt;.</p>

<p>...I blew up the atelier again. It's so weird though...</p>
<p>Vayne helped me clean up again, but I know this is bad. I played around with alchemy before I came to this school, so if I get kicked out, I'll be stuck in jail.</p>
<p>Oh, but next time I do a difficult synthesis, Vayne said he'll help me. Then I can't mess up, right?</p>
</td>
<td style="width: 20%;" class="even">
<p>Once again, Vayne witnesses the result of another of Philo's failed syntheses. After he suggests simply telling a teacher rather than trying to cover it up, the Mana of Wind convinces Philo to reveal that she experimented with alchemy before coming to Al-Revis, which is illegal. Rather than going to prison, she instead attended the academy, where she'd be put in special classes. Even though she'll go to prison if she gets kicked out, she can't help doing the syntheses anyway.</p>
<p>Vayne agrees to help her clean up. Fortunately, the equipment isn't broken this time, but it is a mess. It takes [Polish Powder]x5 to clean it up, but once it's done, the two take the garbage to the incinerator on the &lt;Campus Grounds&gt;. They're stopped by the Vice Principal, who---after messing with them for a bit---lets them slide.</p>
<p>In the end, Vayne tells Philo that he'll help her in the future so as to prevent further explosions.</p>

<td style="width: 20%;" class="odd">
<p>As promised, Vayne helps Philo with one of her syntheses, and it works perfectly. However, she soon faints unexpectedly, and Vayne rushes her to the Infirmary. When she comes to, she reveals that this isn't super uncommon and that medicine doesn't help.</p>
<p>She tells Vayne that she hasn't completed her homework, which requires him to bring [Nectar]x2 to her. When he returns, she is out of bed and, in response to his concern, explains that she had a really serious illness when she was little and, accordingly, has a shorter lifespan than normal. But her generally carefree attitude about it leaves Vayne confused and wondering if it might even be a joke. </p>

<p>CUTSCENE: Philo and Mortality (Classroom)</p>
</td>
<td style="width: 20%;" class="even">
<p>The scene begins in the classroom, the lighting low. Four students stand near the lecturn, Anita among them, crying.</p>
<p></p>
<p>ANITA: Urr... *hic*</p>
<p>KODAMA: Lighten up.</p>
<p>ANITA: But... *sob*</p>
<p>BILLY: Maybe you should just go home for today.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Vayne and Philo enter the room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VAYNE: Good morning.</p>
<p>BILLY: Hey, good morning...</p>
<p>PHILO: What's wrong? Everyone seems so gloomy today.</p>
<p>BILLY: Umm, well see...</p>
<p>BILLY: We got word that her [Anita's] dad ust passed away this morning...</p>
<p>VAYNE: I see...</p>
<p>PHILO: Oh? Well, that can't be helped.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kodama, Anita, Billy, Vayne, and the other unnamed student, all jump in surprise at Philo's comment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>KODAMA: Can't be...? What's that supposed to mean!?</p>
<p>VAYNE: Whoa, Jess...</p>
<p></p>
<p>In contrast to the others, Philo is confused by their response.</p>
<p></p>
<p>PHILO: Well, we're all going to die eventually... It's just sooner or later.</p>
<p>ANITA: ...How could you!?</p>
<p>BILLY: [to Anita] Hey, calm down.</p>
<p>VAYNE: Jess, hurry and apologize!</p>
<p>PHILO: Wh-why are you so mad? It's just that your dad died, right?</p>
<p>ANITA: Whaaaat!?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anita rushes toward Philo in anger, but Billy stops her.</p>
<p></p>
<p>BILLY: Calm down! Hey, get her.</p>
<p>KODAMA: Vayne! Take Jess somewhere else!</p>
<p>VAYNE: Y-yeah! Jess, come here.</p>
<p>PHILO: Huh, Vayne?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Vayne leads Philo out into the hallway.</p>
<p></p>
<p>PHILO: Why is she so mad, and crying... I do't understand it at all.</p>
<p>VAYNE: Well... Someone close to her passed away, so she's probably really sad...</p>
<p>PHILO: Really?</p>
<p>VAYNE: What do you mean?</p>
<p>PHILO: I wouldn't want anyone to be sad when I die.</p>
<p>VAYNE: But... If you're gone, I would be sad, and so would everyone else.</p>
<p>PHILO: What? That's no good... I'm going to die before everyone else, though...</p>
<p>VAYNE: ...So it's true? I mean, about the illness when you were young...</p>
<p>PHILO: Yes, it's true. You thought I was lying.</p>
<p>VAYNE: You seemed so upbeat. And, I didn't want to believe it...</p>
<p>PHILO: I never lie.</p>
<p>PHILO: But, I get it. There are people who get sad, too... I'll go apologize to her.</p>
<p>VAYNE: Oh, yeah...</p>
<p></p>
<p>Philo leaves to apologize to Anita.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VAYNE (alone): So it is true... But she's so...</p>

<td style="width: 20%;" class="odd">
<p>I got in a fight with Vayne. He kept bugging me about my body. But then I fainted right after, and it was Vayne who helped me again...</p>
<p>If I didn't wake up, the last thing we did would have been to fight. It made me sad, and I realized what he meant. But either way, my body won't get any better.</p>
</td>
<td style="width: 20%;" class="odd">
<p>Vayne and Philo attend a class run by Professor Zeppel in &lt;Dragon's Grave: Bone Grove&gt;. After gathering items at five gathering spots, the two get into an argument regarding Philo's perspective on death, though Vayne struggles to articulate why he thinks her perspective is unhealthy.</p>
<p>Philo runs off in anger, complaining to the Mana of Wind (who agrees that her argument isn't entirely sound), but she eventually faints, alone. When the class gathers back in the clearing, Vayne notices that Philo didn't return and runs off to find her. (She can be found in the northwest of &lt;Bone Grove&gt;, near the entrance to &lt;Heaven's Road&gt;.)</p>
<p>Back at the Academy, Philo lies in the Infirmary, where the other workshop members wait anxiously until she wakes up. Once she does, relieved, they take their leave, but Philo calls for Vayne to wait (inducing a joke from Nikki), and the two apologize and make up. </p>

<p>Should I tell everyone about Jess's condition?</p>
</td>
<td style="width: 20%;" class="even">
<p>Oh my god, Vayne is horrible! He tricked me, pretending he was dead. I really thought he died...</p>
<p>But that means everyone will feel this way... when I die. I assumed there was nothing I could do about it, but Vayne promised to cure me. So I want to try my best, too.</p>
</td>
<td style="width: 20%;" class="even">
<p>Vayne gets caught staring off into space and is persuaded to talk about Philo's condition. The group (Nikki, Pamela, Flay, Roxis, Anna, and Muppy) are upset with Vayne for having kept it a secret, and Flay says they'll find a punishment for Vayne later.</p>
<p>When Vayne expresses that while he would like to help her physical condition, he is more concerned about Philo's mental health and perspective on the issue. Flay instructs Vayne to bring a Red Soup, Bomb Ice, and Veggielicious. Confused but without another idea, Vayne does as Flay suggests.</p>
<p>Flay then gives secret (to both Vayne and the player) instructions to the other group members, laying out his plan to them. Anna criticizes it for it being in bad taste, though Roxis points out that it would be effective, and the group decides to execute it. Soon after, the screen fades to black, and combat sounds are heard&amp;emdash;Flay's "punishment" from earlier.</p>
<p>Philo rushes into the room, panicked, one of the other group members likely parroting Flay's suggestion to her off-screen. The camera pans to show Vayne, alone, face down and unconscious on the workshop carpet, where Philo quickly joins him. Her panic continues when she finds him cold, and Nikki, Anna, Roxis, and Muppy soon fall in behind her, heads bowed in presumed sadness.</p>
<p>"Why... why...?" Philo cries out in anguish as the others lament that they didn't make it in time, that they'd told Vayne so many times to stop with the dangerous experiments(!), that a good man was lost. "No, this isn't... I don't want... Vayne!"</p>
<p>Her cries, however, seem to wake him up, though Philo doesn't immediately process his question as coming from him. It's only when he asks if she's sad that she pauses, and Flay jumps into the conversation, only amplifying her confusion, especially as Roxis, Anna, and Nikki confess to the plot (though they blame Flay).</p>
<p>Philo then runs off in anger, and Flay takes some heat from the group for going too far before Vayne rushes to find Philo on the roof.</p>
<p>Vayne tries to explain that he wanted Philo to understand how everyone would feel if/when she died, and apologizes so many times that Philo comments on it, causing him to apologize once more. It breaks the tension, however, and the two share a laugh before Philo calms down and expresses her own heartfelt apologies. Vayne then promises to cure her if she'll also try her best, and it's revealed that everyone one else will help as well.</p>

<td style="width: 20%;" class="even">
<p>The Vice Principal stops by the workshop in search of Anna, whose grades are slipping. Anna enters shortly after the VP leaves, and the others relay the VP's message.</p>
<p>Anna explains that, though she studies and follows the older students' examples, she's unable to get her efforts to show on her grades, saying that she's struggling to grasp the basics.</p>
<p>At Flay's suggestion, the group begins to tutor Anna on the basics, and Philo suggests they synthesize a difficult item in order from the very beginning in order to highlight the process, and Roxis suggests a Super Nectar.</p>
<p>When Anna knows the ingredients for the Super Nectar but not those for the component Briliant Stone and Preservative, Philo suggests making a Polish Powder and the group resolves Anna's confusion by pointing out that it's the main ingredient in the Brilliant Stone.</p>
<p>The other ingredients can be gathered from Dragon's Grave - Bone Grove ("Chrome Crystal") and the Millennium Tree ("Fruit").</p>
<p>During this process, the VP returns to see the group helping Anna with her studies and offers her a special make-up exam (...after expressing her worry of leaving the situation up to Flay and the others).</p>
<p>Anna takes the make-up exam a few days later and reports that while it wasn't perfect, she believes it was adequate enough, thanks to the group's help.</p>

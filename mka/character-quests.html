                        As Vayne walks through the workshop hallway, he hears an explosion coming from the workshop.
                        There, he finds Philo, covered in soot from her failed synthesis. After a short conversation
                        (where the Mana of Wind tells Vayne that Philo <i>is just used to explosions</i>), they gather
                        new equipment from <b>Someone's Workshop</b> in the Workshop Hallway and dispose of the trash in
                        the incinerator on the <b>Campus Grounds</b>.

                    <p>
                        Once again, Vayne witnesses the result of another of Philo's failed syntheses. After he suggests
                        simply telling a teacher, rather than trying to cover it up, the Mana of Light convinces Philo
                        to reveal that she experimented with alchemy before coming to Al-Revis, which is illegal.
                        Instead of going to prison, she was invited to the academy, where she'd be put in special
                        classes. But <i>If she gets kicked out, Jess is gonna go right back to prison</i>, but she can't
                        help doing the syntheses anyway.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vayne agrees to help her clean up. Fortunately, the equipment isn't broken this time, but it is
                        a mess. It take <b>5 [Polish Powder]</b> to clean it, but once it's done, the two take the
                        garbage to the incinerator on the <b>Campus Grounds</b>, where they're stopped by the Vice
                        Principal, who—after messing with them a little bit—lets them slide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the end, Vayne tells Philo that he'll help her in the future so as to prevent further
                        explosions.
                    </p>

                    <p>Vayne helped me clean up again, but I know this is bad. I played around with alchemy before I
                        came to this school, so if I get kicked out, I'll be stuck in jail.</p>
                    <p>Oh, but next time I do a difficult synthesis, Vayne said he'll help me. Then I can't mess up,
                        right?</p>

                        As promises, Vayne helps Philo with one of her syntheses, and it works perfectly. However, she
                        soon faints unexpectedly, and Vayne rushes her to the <b>Infirmary</b>. When she comes to, she
                        reveals that this isn't super uncommon and that medicine doesn't help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She tells Vayne that she hasn't completed her homework, which requires him to bring <b>2
                            [Nectar]</b> to her. When he returns, she is out of bed and, in response to his concern,
                        explains that she had a really serious illness when she was little and, accordingly, has a
                        shorter lifespan than normal. But her generally carefree attitude about it leaves Vayne confused
                        and wondering if it might even be a joke.

                    <p>
                        Vayne and Philo attend a class run by Professor Zeppel in Dragon's Grave: Bone Grove. After
                        gathering items at five gathering spots, the two get into an argument regarding Philo's
                        perspective on death, though Vayne struggles to articulate why he thinks her perspective is
                        unhealthy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Philo runs off in anger, complaining to the Mana of Wind (who agrees that her argument isn't
                        entirely sound), but she eventually faints, alone. When the class gathers back in the clearing,
                        Vayne notices that Philo didn't return and runs off to find her. (<i>She can be found in the
                            northwest of Bone Grove, near the entrance to Heaven's Road</i>.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Back at the Academy, Philo lies in the Infirmary, where the other workshop members wait
                        anxiously until she wakes up. Once she does, relieved, they take their leave, but Philo calls
                        for Vayne to wait (inducing a joke from Nikki), and the two apologize and make up.

                    <td style="width: 20%;">As Vayne walks through the workshop hallway, he hears an explosion coming
                        from the workshop. After a short conversation, he and Philo gather new equipment from
                        &lt;Someone's Workshop&gt; and dispose of the trash in the incinerator on the &lt;Campus

                    <td style="width: 20%;">...I blew up the atelier again. It's so weird though...<br />Vayne helped me
                        clean up again, but I know this is bad. I played around with alchemy before I came to this
                        school, so if I get kicked out, I'll be stuck in jail.<br />Oh, but next time I do a difficult
                        synthesis, Vayne said he'll help me. Then I can't mess up, right?</td>
                    <td style="width: 20%;">Once again, Vayne witnesses the result of another of Philo's failed
                        syntheses. After he suggests simply telling a teacher rather than trying to cover it up, the
                        Mana of Wind convinces Philo to reveal that she experimented with alchemy before coming to
                        Al-Revis, which is illegal. Rather than going to prison, she instead attended the academy, where
                        she'd be put in special classes. Even though she'll go to prison if she gets kicked out, she
                        can't help doing the syntheses anyway.<br />Vayne agrees to help her clean up. Fortunately, the
                        equipment isn't broken this time, but it is a mess. It takes [Polish Powder]x5 to clean it up,
                        but once it's done, the two take the garbage to the incinerator on the &lt;Campus Grounds&gt;.
                        They're stopped by the Vice Principal, who---after messing with them for a bit---lets them
                        slide.<br />In the end, Vayne tells Philo that he'll help her in the future so as to prevent
                        further explosions.</td>

                    <td style="width: 20%;">I fainted during synthesis. I felt perfectly fine lately, so it caught me
                        off guard. Vayne saw it, too. I asked him to keep it a secret, but...<br />Oh well. It can't be
                        helped. I was sick when I was young, and because of it...</td>
                    <td style="width: 20%;">As promised, Vayne helps Philo with one of her syntheses, and it works
                        perfectly. However, she soon faints unexpectedly, and Vayne rushes her to the Infirmary. When
                        she comes to, she reveals that this isn't super uncommon and that medicine doesn't
                        help.<br />She tells Vayne that she hasn't completed her homework, which requires him to bring
                        [Nectar]x2 to her. When he returns, she is out of bed and, in response to his concern, explains
                        that she had a really serious illness when she was little and, accordingly, has a shorter
                        lifespan than normal. But her generally carefree attitude about it leaves Vayne confused and
                        wondering if it might even be a joke. </td>

                    <td style="width: 20%;"></td>
                    <td style="width: 20%;">Vayne and Philo attend a class run by Professor Zeppel in &lt;Dragon's
                        Grave: Bone Grove&gt;. After gathering items at five gathering spots, the two get into an
                        argument regarding Philo's perspective on death, though Vayne struggles to articulate why he
                        thinks her perspective is unhealthy.<br />Philo runs off in anger, complaining to the Mana of
                        Wind (who agrees that her argument isn't entirely sound), but she eventually faints, alone. When
                        the class gathers back in the clearing, Vayne notices that Philo didn't return and runs off to
                        find her. (She can be found in the northwest of &lt;Bone Grove&gt;, near the entrance to
                        &lt;Heaven's Road&gt;.)<br />Back at the Academy, Philo lies in the Infirmary, where the other
                        workshop members wait anxiously until she wakes up. Once she does, relieved, they take their
                        leave, but Philo calls for Vayne to wait (inducing a joke from Nikki), and the two apologize and
                        make up. </td>

            The achievement title is a reference to <i>Mana Khemia 2: The Fall of Alchemy</i>, where Marta Schevesti is hired as the chairwoman to Al-Revis. In her quest to reduce the operating costs of the school, she suggests discontinuing the alchemy classes, removing it from the curriculum.

            Obviously, we cannot complete the game without synthesizing anything, as there are, in fact, required syntheses forced upon us throughout the story (not even including any that may be "required").
        </p>

        <h2>Theoretical Minimum</h2>
        <p>
            Let's find the absolute theoretical minimum number of syntheses: the ones 100% required as part of the main story:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>C1W2 (Synthesis I Basics):</b> As part of our first assignment, we get the synthesis tutorial, where we're forced to synthesize a [Heal Jar].
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>C1W3 (Combat I Basics):</b> While it's not required for the assignment, <i>per se</i>, Philo does force us to "power up" before we can go to the Wind's Corridor. This serves as the Athanor tutorial, where we're forced to synthesize the [Ragged Collar].
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>C1W4 (Nicro Cloth Event):</b> In order to be allowed to continue using the atelier, we're forced to synthesize a [Nicro Cloth]. Although we don't play the normal synthesis minigame for this one, we do still gain a [Nicro Cloth] in our inventory, so this still counts.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>C2W6 (Final Exam Event):</b> We can avoid synthing anything for most of Chapter 2 (and both character quests are safe), but we are forced to make a [Dietary Fiber] for the final exam.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>C7W7 (Trivia Contest Event):</b> We skip forward quite a bit on this one. We've had to avoid some of the character quests (Philo II, Nikki II, Pamela I, etc.), and we had to choose <i>Combat III: Chain</i> for our choice Chapter 5 course. But, during the Trivia Contest, we are forced to make a [Giant's Ring].
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            That should cover everything. In Chapter 8, we can take <i>Alchemy History</i> and <i>Combat IV: Preservation</i> to avoid the two Synthesis courses, in Chapter 9, we can take <i>Naturology II</i> and <i>Combat V: Power</i>, and in Chapter 11, we can <i>Symbology II</i>, <i>Combat VI: Speed</i> and/or <i>Combat VII: Chain</i>. And since none of the character quests are required, nor are there any synthesis requirements for any of the end-chapter events (8: Mana Medicine, 9: The Mana Experiments, 10: Sulpher and the Dragon Energy, 11: The Truth about Vayne, 12: Heart's Prison), we're done.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>But...</i> while five is the theoretical minimum, it wouldn't surprise me if some of the combat courses were out of our league, given that we have neither a lot of powerful items nor filled-in Grow Books. If that's the case, then we may need to take a Synthesis course, as the list I gave above assumed that we could sneak by with only two courses per term, but that requires getting an [A] in both of them. Plus, you know, all of the chapter bosses, and while we can certainly beat «Lore Beast» without any additional syntheses, I'm not convinced that we can beat «Vayne». Though, conveniently, we don't have to fight «Crazed Eye» if we don't finish any character quests.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then again... on a NG+ run, that "5" might genuinely be doable.

                <span class="trophy-name">Aww, how cute!</span><br />
                Complete the game while fighting a "minimum" number of battles.

            Ah, the pacifist run. Okay, so, it's obviously not possible to beat the game without fighting anything. There are actually quite a few required fights forced upon us by the story. Though, unlike with the minimal-syntheses run, this one's a little bit more straightforward. This sort of follows a no-Grow-Book challenge approach, as our AP will be fairly limited, and I know for a fact that the game's beatable at 0% /GB. So, with that in mind, let's trace out all of the required fights:
        </p>

        <div>

        <p>
            The first thing to notice is that we don't fight «Crazed Eye». That's intentional, but it also means that we don't finish any charater quests (making Philo the one whom Isolde kills in chapter 11).
        </p>

        <p>
            The next thing to notice is that we've tallied up a total of <b>22 fights</b> that result in the deaths of 46 enemies (48 if you want to count «Zweis Monde» as two pixies).

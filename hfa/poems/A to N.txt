TITLE: A to N
ID: a-to-n

I rest my hand flat against the stone
as moments pass so uneventfully,
as time is forced into unifor_mity_,
an inevitable meaninglessness
I can't, alone, hope to _miti_gate.

My breaths shallow into desperation
as tension builds within my chest—
My heartbeat, for its proxi_mity_,
is spared no second thought, I see,
faintly screaming its infir_mity_.

And should a heartbeat fail, of course,
it draws upon th'extre_miti_es,
explaining well the trembling, shivering
cold I've learned to call mine
as I'm plunged into mountains' anony_mity_.

So, it is no great surprise, perhaps,
to see such unani_mity_ in the vote—
For, after all, labels define, and
the balcony girl insists it's no cala_mity_
to see her lover thusly named.

    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            Love, that feeling who dances brightly in your heart—<br/>
            Hate, that feeling who would rather burn a hole straight through it.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Love, that feeling who puts a smile on your face—<br/>
            Hate, that feeling who contorts it to a grimace.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Love, that feeling who makes all the troubles of the world just seem worth it somehow—<br/>
            Hate, that feeling who makes the end not worth fighting for.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Love, that Queen of emotions—<br/>
            Hate, her Assassin.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            They say the opposite of Love is Hate,<br/>
            and the two are oft opposed.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            But Love is in rushing home; Hate is in running away.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            You see, then, they're wrong:<br/>
            Two sides of the same coin,<br/>
            antipodal, perhaps,<br/>
            yet made of precisely the same mettle.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            For it is Void, known too by her many names,<br/>
            who is their opposite.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Love dances, Hate burns—<br/>
            Void is still and lukewarm.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Love smiles, Hate grimaces—<br/>
            Void has but a blank expression on her face.<br/>
            Love comforts, Hate fuels—<br/>
            Void drains.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Love rushes home, Hate runs away—<br/>
            Void is too lazy to sit.<br/>
            Void is too lazy to even notice she has a problem.<br/>
            Void is hungry, all-consuming,<br/>
            and any can become her victim.
        </p>

TITLE: Hollow
ID: hollow

Your words echo through my brain
like through the empty space between the snow-capped mountains,
like they'll cause the fated avalanche to begin.

Your words echo through my brain
until I could, from memory, recite them all,
until you've long forgotten their existence.

Your words echo through my brain,
your thoughts usurping mine,
your promises loud within my ears.

Your words echo through my brain
yet echo not through yours.

TITLE: Because she could not stop for Change
ID: because-she-could-not-stop-for-change

It is not that she should fear for change
that she should wish things stay the same,
that she should preserve the status quo,
but the distress of it,
the rush of time's forward arrow no longer silent,
no longer the ignorable force of her life
that drives its monotony forward,
but the distress of it,
the rush of conscious recognition of her failèd present,
a gift that she should treasure, relish in,
for none is but the momentary present—
no past but the memories, no future but the dreams,
moving Zeno-like from one to another,
as is all nature—all its fractal complexities
ought nothing but smooth appear.

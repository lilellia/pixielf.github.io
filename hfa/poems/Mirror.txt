TITLE: Mirror
ID: mirror

There's something about the way she looks at me,
her vacant expression peering from blue-gray eyes
that house a world of uniform overcast,
a world of skies who promise
neither the gentle joy of the sun
nor the feral anger of the storm.

Her unkempt hair falls lazily and chaotically
around her shoulders, framing her visage
quite unlike any portrait she'd commission.
Yet the world has rendered it for her, free of chargeâ€”
a gift she didn't ask for, a gift she didn't want.

I can feel her chest tighten
as her breath quickens
and shallows,
as her heart beats quietly
against its oft rediscovered cage.

We stare a long time into each other's eyes,
neither of us daring to move,
but this isn't the amorous abyss I've heard exists
in your real-world faerie tales.

Instead, it's merely a mirror.

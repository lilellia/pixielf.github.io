    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            It's no surprise that a Storm-battered ship<br/>
            should fail to re-meet the shore,<br/>
            But neither will a ship in the Doldrums,<br/>
            no Wind to feed her sails.
        </p>
        <p>
            The former's fate is no more enviable,<br/>
            nor less—<br/>
            but that it is seen as an honorable death<br/>
            to "go down with the ship".
        </p>
        <p>
            But what torture is it, rather,<br/>
            to sit, confined, with nothing, no one<br/>
            in the world to aid you—<br/>
            To be dependant on something, someone else,<br/>
            To trust to guide you home, safe—
        </p>
        <p>
            Storm is a mercy undesirable:<br/>
            a quick death affording<br/>
            an escape,<br/>
            an excuse,<br/>
            a distraction if none else—
        </p>
        <p>
            But Storm is still an enemy, of course,<br/>
            vicious, cruel, unyielding—<br/>
            But Storm is still an enemy, of course,<br/>
            chaos, noise, destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the opposite—the empty days with ne'er a breeze:<br/>
            friendly Wind's simple absence or <br/>
            foe Doldrum's emptying presence?<br/>
            One cannot tell at first.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's the opposite of an epiphany—<br/>
            not the insuddenness of a drawn-out realization<br/>
            but the lack of realization altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
            For, in fact—the empty days with ne'er a breeze:<br/>
            friendly Wind's simple absence or <br/>
            foe Doldrum's emptying presence?
        </p>

TITLE: Masquerade
ID: masquerade

I hear the chatter dying down,
Or so it would appear.
I take a deep breath, calming down
Before I voice my fear.

But even ere I can speak up,
I've lost my voice again.
Something must have stolen it—
I know not what nor when.

A sea of faces, glancing o'er
The space I occupy.
They cannot see nor hear me now,
No matter how I try.

But on the other hand, of course,
I do not try at all:
There's nothing that I need to say—
I'm just an empty doll.

An empty doll who's hiding now.
I'm right here in plain sight.
...Or, would I be, my truth exposed,
If I knew what was right.

Alas, alas, I mock myself:
The truth hid yet from me.
Two decades past, myself at last,
I, finally, am free.

There were words once, that passed my lips
Foreign and beguiled.
Having removed my unseen mask,
I'm no longer exiled.

And so now, I can take a stand,
Happy now, and free.
I've now a role I'd never planned:
Now I, myself, am me.

TITLE: [M4] The Way They Fly
ID: the-way-they-fly

There's something about the way they fly,
So carefree.
Flying this way and that,
Loop-the-loops and corkscrews.
They don't look like they're trying.
Why do they even bother?

I fly with perfect form:
Wings spread, head held high.
I fly with the wind that guides me.
It shows me where I want to go:
An isle of endless fortune.

I watch them fly.
Why can't they see
That such flight won't get them anywhere,
Anywhere but here?

I... I fly with perfect form,
But I think that looks more fun.
And that guiding wind seems too great a force,
Pushing faster than I want to go.
Now, I'm done listening.

I tell it so.

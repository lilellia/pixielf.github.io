TITLE: They say the opposite of Love is
ID: they-say-the-opposite-of-love-is

Love, that feeling who dances brightly in your heart—
Hate, that feeling who would rather burn a hole straight through it.

Love, that feeling who puts a smile on your face—
Hate, that feeling who contorts it to a grimace.

Love, that feeling who makes all the troubles of the world just seem worth it somehow—
Hate, that feeling who makes the end not worth fighting for.

Love, that Queen of emotions—
Hate, her Assassin.

They say the opposite of Love is Hate,
and the two are oft opposed.

But Love is in rushing home; Hate is in running away.

You see, then, they're wrong:
Two sides of the same coin,
antipodal, perhaps,
yet made of precisely the same mettle.

For it is Void, known too by her many names,
who is their opposite.

Love dances, Hate burns—
Void is still and lukewarm.

Love smiles, Hate grimaces—
Void has but a blank expression on her face.
Love comforts, Hate fuels—
Void drains.

Love rushes home, Hate runs away—
Void is too lazy to sit.
Void is too lazy to even notice she has a problem.
Void is hungry, all-consuming,
and any can become her victim.

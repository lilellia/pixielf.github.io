TITLE: [M3] Do You Believe in Destiny?
ID: do-you-believe-in-destiny


Your first attempt at anything
Is going to be subpar.
Set the bar a little lower,
Start with something small.
Climb up there, step by step.
Ready, go! Again, again!

You think that you can't do this,
That this comes naturally.
I'm telling you: you can,
But you don't listen when I speak.

It's only that I've done the work
That let me get this far.
Please don't judge me just for thatâ€”
When you do, it breaks my heart.

You've placed me on a pedestal
(Which I don't think is right).
And, because you've distanced me,
Real friends are hard to find.

If you knew me for who I am,
You'd see that I'm in reach.
But... Maybe it's just my destiny
That you don't see me for me.

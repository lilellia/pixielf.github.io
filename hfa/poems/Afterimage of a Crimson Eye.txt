TITLE: [Y4] Afterimage of a Crimson Eye
ID: afterimage


I close my eyes.
I see them still.
I am unsure whether it's just my imagination,
But this isn’t the same empty blackness I was used to.

I shake in excitement, or is it fear?
I sat, huddled, pressed as tightly in the corner as my body would allow.
The only light was the thinnest sliver of the faintness of Diana’s globe
Under the door.

I opened the door, still demanding to win that vital game of hide-and-seek.
She sat on the floor.
He was there no longer.
He must have hidden.
I tried to seek.

The dim light of her globe gave me the blessing I required.
My keepsake, beautifully crafted, left carelessly on the floor.
I picked it up. It felt molded to my hand,
Its ordained purpose now fixed to this situation.

I shake in excitement—it isn't fear.

For me, he came.
For me, they went.
For them, I suffer.
Then.
Now.
Forever.
It’s my fortune.
I close my eyes.
I see him still.

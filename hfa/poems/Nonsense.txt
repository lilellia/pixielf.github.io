TITLE: Nonsense
ID: nonsense

I sit motionless, blankly watching
as the blackness behind my closèd eyes
remains unchanged, still black
as they send their imaginations into overdrive—
blacker yet
than the night while Selene sleeps upon her duty,
than the loneliest ocean depths not even the anglerfish dare haunt,
than the black hole's horizons of hundred-trillion Pascal pressures
that match not the one I feel to fill this void—

It is childish to believe in ghosts:
I do not feel the phantom touch upon my shoulder
where she not long ago placed her hand,
where she not log ago sent a pulse through my nerves,
a such aphantom touch
that one might suspect my heart its epicenter;
yet, its present shimmer of a forgotten oasis
in this desert of indistinguishable smoothness
cannot satisfy this thirst I cannot even express.

So blessèd to drink are they.

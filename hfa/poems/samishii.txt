Each bird does fly with its own wings,
nor would they wish to share,
so one is last, by math's own hand,
yet the bird seems not to care.

The birdling stays within its nest.
There, watching from below,
loudly she claims, her friends unblamed:
It hurts not to be slow.

The other birds, alighting down,
speak oft of their long flights.
Our little birdling listens long,
listens throughout the night.

She knows full well that she'd the same,
their roles, by magic, made reversed.
Were she the one to chase her dreams,
her voice would squeal in verse.

Each bird foes fly with its own wings
and fly on its own pace.
For some, alas, a pace minute:
It's a truth which she must face.

And so she dreams, her dreams held high,
but anxious yet is she.
Each story told, she asks herself,
"What if that's not for me?"

Their stories echo through the trees,
and though she feigns like joy,
their stories echo 'gainst her skull,
her brain those sounds' mere toy.

Ironic, then, amidst their crowd,
she's left to feel alone.
She dreams and dreams to match their acts,
her world as cold as stone.

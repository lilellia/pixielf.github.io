    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            There's something about the way they fly,<br/>
            So carefree.<br/>
            Flying this way and that,<br/>
            Loop-the-loops and corkscrews.<br/>
            They don't look like they're trying.<br/>
            Why do they even bother?<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I fly with perfect form:<br/>
            Wings spread, head held high.<br/>
            I fly with the wind that guides me.<br/>
            It shows me where I want to go:<br/>
            An isle of endless fortune.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I watch them fly.<br/>
            Why can't they see<br/>
            That such flight won't get them anywhere,<br/>
            Anywhere but here?<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I... I fly with perfect form,<br/>
            But I think that looks more fun.<br/>
            And that guiding wind seems too great a force,<br/>
            Pushing faster than I want to go.<br/>
            Now, I'm done listening.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I tell it so.
        </p>

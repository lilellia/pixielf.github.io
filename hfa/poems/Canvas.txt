TITLE: Canvas
ID: canvas



The nighttime sky is a canvas,
written on by the gods,
the stars' white ink pooling in their poetry
until Apollo brings the sun.
And so it was that nature's authors wrote their works
above the heads of man.

I dreamed, once,
that I could see how it all ends,
the fate of the world written all on the pages at my fingertips
if I could only make out the words.

But the more I stared,
the more the pages faded away.
What I wouldn't give to know their words,
to know if things might get better,
if hope is worth the risk,
if I should even try.

You say we write our feelings and our dreams
onto the unstructured, unjudging void,
that it's true that it bears me no good will,
nor does it bear a grudge.

The fluid sky has no strength, no memory, no shame.
It isn't the solid, unchanging, heartless stone, after all.

    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            I close my eyes. <br/>
            I see them still. <br/>
            I am unsure whether it's just my imagination, <br/>
            But this isn’t the same empty blackness I was used to.
        </p>
        <p>
            I shake in excitement, or is it fear? <br/>
            I sat, huddled, pressed as tightly in the corner as my body would allow. <br/>
            The only light was the thinnest sliver of the faintness of Diana’s globe <br/>
            Under the door.
        </p>
        <p>
            I opened the door, still demanding to win that vital game of hide-and-seek. <br/>
            She sat on the floor. <br/>
            He was there no longer. <br/>
            He must have hidden. <br/>
            I tried to seek.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dim light of her globe gave me the blessing I required. <br/>
            My keepsake, beautifully crafted, left carelessly on the floor. <br/>
            I picked it up. It felt molded to my hand, <br/>
            Its ordained purpose now fixed to this situation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I shake in excitement—it isn't fear.
        </p>
        <p>
            For me, he came. <br/>
            For me, they went. <br/>
            For them, I suffer. <br/>
            Then. <br/>
            Now. <br/>
            Forever. <br/>
            It’s my fortune. <br/>
            I close my eyes. <br/>
            I see him still.
        </p>

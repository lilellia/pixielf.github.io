TITLE: Not Enough Chemistry
ID: not-enough-chemistry

I hear what must be my voice,
fluttering almost imperceptibly aloud—
desperately withheld—

I hear your voice: it calls to me, loud,
as the waterfall crashing against my back,
as I struggle to breathe under its aquatic weight.

You ironically echo my once-unreciprocated thoughts—
begging to change mind, pronouns reversed.
Jealous pity escapes me—
criss-crossed threads of contradiction
in the heart I wear on my sleeve.

It is no magic forcefield which repels us,
nor are we magnets of the same pole—
but that I selfishly pull away in disappointment
before I should cower in your shame.

I know you chase a certain hope,
believed it could be me—what I
believed unrequited thoughts,
echoing painfully against my skull.

I feel you flinch before I've opened my mouth,
expectant of my mapped response.
Yet, you hold your tongue, knowing, too,
this pained regret in my voice.

Unambiguously trembling
as words quiver outward
of what must be their own accord—
It pounds strongly in my head,
battering nearly equally to your waterfall
which bears no secret behind its roar
but a certain, fatedly inhuman crack.

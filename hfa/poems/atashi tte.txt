TITLE: or: All These Beautiful Promises
ID: atashi-tte



I hear their words carry through the air,
Refined and full of grace,
Incapable of being but true.

All these beautiful promises
Are no great show of importance,
But the simple things,
Worth a world unto themselves.

All these beautiful promises
Ring out in confluent octaves,
Washing away my scars
Earned from chasing mirages
Half-revealed by the glint of the moon.

All these beautiful promises
Reach out to me with all their stars' warmth,
Unmatched by the soulless sword of dark
With no power to slice through fate.

All these beautiful promises
Come from a home, your affection,
Reminders of what great kindness may bring forth—
If only we'd believe.

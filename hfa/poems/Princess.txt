TITLE: Princess
ID: princess

I am Princess of Cold, of Push, of Away—
no secret title but of flagrant connotations.
I scoff at its taste, more bitter than any unripened fruit,
no sweeter for knowing it was long ago plucked from its vine,
no sweeter for knowing the taste could not be imagined,
so true is its cause.

For I am she as
a whirlwind roars, its own power supplanting mine,
instilling fear I wish I couldn't recognize.
The battle rages with no clear winner,
my skull feelings
each and
every
blow.

I am Princess of Cold, of Push, of Away—
desperate yet to behold
her Princess of Warmth, of Embrace, of Smile.

Still I am she as
she cowers in her icy domain,
no terran lair nor celestial tower.

For rather than her desirèd seen,
'tis none but the darkly blinding Queen
of Blaze, of Burn, of Grimace.

I am Princess of Cold, of Push, of Away—
for ice is fragile and belies no other defense.

TITLE: [S3] Wind
ID: wind

I hear the winds' gentle breeze outside my window.
I see the tree branches swaying lazily.
Kids in the nearby park fly kites against the blue skies,
And part of me wants to join them.

I close my eyes.

I hear the winds' stronger gusts rattle against my skull.
I see the tree branches crashing wildly.
The sky darkens, the near-blue clarity now full of clouds.
It looks like it might rain.

The winds grow stronger, howling now.
The branches groan and creak under the weight of the winds.
These sounds overwhelm my mind, and it's all I can hear.
The sky darkens... darkens... darkens... until its just cloudsâ€”
The sun hid long ago.

Are those kids still there?
Their kites won't last in these winds.
Are those kids still there?
I certainly don't want to join them.

I open my eyes.

The sun shines.

    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            I hear the chatter dying down,<br/>
            Or so it would appear.<br/>
            I take a deep breath, calming down<br/>
            Before I voice my fear.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            But even ere I can speak up,<br/>
            I've lost my voice again.<br/>
            Something must have stolen it—<br/>
            I know not what nor when.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            A sea of faces, glancing o'er<br/>
            The space I occupy.<br/>
            They cannot see nor hear me now,<br/>
            No matter how I try.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            But on the other hand, of course,<br/>
            I do not try at all:<br/>
            There's nothing that I need to say—<br/>
            I'm just an empty doll.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            An empty doll who's hiding now.<br/>
            I'm right here in plain sight.<br/>
            ...Or, would I be, my truth exposed,<br/>
            If I knew what was right.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Alas, alas, I mock myself:<br/>
            The truth hid yet from me.<br/>
            Two decades past, myself at last,<br/>
            I, finally, am free.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            There were words once, that passed my lips<br/>
            Foreign and beguiled.<br/>
            Having removed my unseen mask,<br/>
            I'm no longer exiled.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            And so now, I can take a stand,<br/>
            Happy now, and free.<br/>
            I've now a role I'd never planned:<br/>
            Now I, myself, am me.
        </p>

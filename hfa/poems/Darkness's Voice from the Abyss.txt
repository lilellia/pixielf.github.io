TITLE: Darkness's Voice from the Abyss
ID: darkness

His voice echoes within my head,
Interchangeable with mine,
Ringing with my deep desires,
My conscious thoughts not quite aligned.

Against life's struggles, I ascend
Atop the mountains' peaks—
A famous fruit of highest tree,
A magic one can't speak.

Heaven's road is just in sight,
T'explore, new friends in tow,
And find great beauty in these skies,
Yet at a cost too great to know.

For beyond those dragons' fearsome strength,
Bones to ruins turn—
Deep within the crystal caves
Lies great magic, caged and spurned.

Trapped within its crystal jail,
A seeming flower bloomed in void,
A single cry to me alone,
And its hope found soon destroyed.

Parallel, an ally's betrayal,
Her helping smile turned to ice.
Against her will, we all survive.
But it's not without its price.

And what to pay for the mere truth,
Her outstretched hand but a façade?
I've just to trust her tinted words.
Baited with knowledge, I cast my rod.

I tread in her nostalgia den,
Where wisdom duly slumbers.
Her promised story screams with pain,
with loss, with shame, with blunders.

It's an "act of god" that proves her point,
Yet no god lies in sight—
And so its shows that I'm the monster
She'd long hoped to indict.

A quiet secret that she released,
That by illusion, I'd forgotten.
Her voice rattling through my mind,
They all act with distant caution.

And so, alone, I find myself,
Pack what little luggage I may.
My heart imprisoned by its pain,
I cannot but hope to pray.

A lonely soul to cast aside,
Hovering at the precipice—
To be no threat to anyone,
I press my ear to the abyss.

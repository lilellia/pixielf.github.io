ID: rules-of-a-foreign-craft

Bound up yet by the selfsame rule
on how nothing will come of nothing,
whatever other machinations may lie beyond,
I can make not heads nor tales—

For I have seen its yielded creatures
with more than one of each:
chimeric monsters of nightmares' dreams
I could ne'er hope to understand.

And yet for all these vicious horrors,
outnumbering them all as blades of grass
are the supposedly mundane works
that far more like magic seem—

For what rules of merest science
could hope to e'en compete
with reviving smoothies, evasive pies,
swords to summon fire?

For what rules of merest science
could hope to e'en compete
with their powers alien,
unparalleled, unfair?

For what rules of merest science
could hope to e'en compete
with steelèd gold, depthless bags,
potions t'induce true love?

TITLE: Hesitation
ID: hesitation

O, that Time should stop
its measured measure ever onward,
its anxious advance toward th'inevitable future,
its fervent fixture on what may only come to pass
that infect us with the same—
a certain skepticism of a present
that we might otherwise enjoy.

And we, thus robbed of beating hearts'
crescendo keyed t'our eagerness,
their tornado keeping us from being zombies through life,
their credo keen to to save us from despair—
And we, thus robbed of beating hearts,
are forced to look only on—

For it is no secret of th'universe
that all good things must have their end,
that "Friend" is not our name for "Time",
that he cannot heal but at best numb,
that the more things stay, the more the change—

And so it is that e'en a future bright with hopeful charm,
th'antithesis of our present rife with even boredom,
should prove itself a hidden darkness
to us who know Time's twisted games—

For it is a darkness darker yet in that lost light's faint wake.

        <p>
            I am Princess of Cold, of Push, of Away—<br/>
            no secret title but of flagrant connotations.<br/>
            I scoff at its taste, more bitter than any unripened fruit,<br/>
            no sweeter for knowing it was long ago plucked from its vine,<br/>
            no sweeter for knowing the taste could not be imagined,<br/>
            so true is its cause.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            For I am she as<br/>
            a whirlwind roars, its own power supplanting mine,<br/>
            instilling fear I wish I couldn't recognize.<br/>
            The battle rages with no clear winner,<br/>
            my skull feelings<br/>
            each and<br/>
            every<br/>
            blow.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I am Princess of Cold, of Push, of Away—<br/>
            desperate yet to behold<br/>
            her Princess of Warmth, of Embrace, of Smile.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Still I am she as<br/>
            she cowers in her icy domain,<br/>
            no terran lair nor celestial tower.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            For rather than her desirèd seen,<br/>
            'tis none but the darkly blinding Queen<br/>
            of Blaze, of Burn, of Grimace.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I am Princess of Cold, of Push, of Away—<br/>
            for ice is fragile and belies no other defense.
        </p>

TITLE: One Begets the Other
ID: one-begets-the-other

It's no surprise that a Storm-battered ship
should fail to re-meet the shore,
But neither will a ship in the Doldrums,
no Wind to feed her sails.

The former's fate is no more enviable,
nor less—
but that it is seen as an honorable death
to "go down with the ship".

But what torture is it, rather,
to sit, confined, with nothing, no one
in the world to aid you—
To be dependant on something, someone else,
To trust to guide you home, safe—

Storm is a mercy undesirable:
a quick death affording
an escape,
an excuse,
a distraction if none else—

But Storm is still an enemy, of course,
vicious, cruel, unyielding—
But Storm is still an enemy, of course,
chaos, noise, destruction.

But the opposite—the empty days with ne'er a breeze:
friendly Wind's simple absence or
foe Doldrum's emptying presence?
One cannot tell at first.

It's the opposite of an epiphany—
not the insuddenness of a drawn-out realization
but the lack of realization altogether.

For, in fact—the empty days with ne'er a breeze:
friendly Wind's simple absence or
foe Doldrum's emptying presence?

TITLE: [Y3] Glory of a Battle
ID: glory-of-a-battle

An ambush should be impossible:
My view of the plain is unobstructed.
I will see them coming.

I am a warrior, my only fealty to goddess Nike.
I shall find my enemy, whosoever he may be,
And he shall feel the point of my sword
Embedded in his flesh.

My blade itches to spill some blood,
To be thusly crimson-stained.
I refuse to disappoint.

I've waited, attentive, for my enemy to arrive—
An ambush should be impossible!
But what else could this be?
Lacerations tracing patterns across my skin—
Betrayed by my own blade.

It seems I've found my enemy
And must no longer wait.

TITLE: Sand Castle
ID: sand-castle

As the high tide rushes in,
I look to my newly-leveled progress,
the crenellations' defenses powerless
against the universe's clockwork flow.

As the ocean lets out its six-hour breath,
I turn to the newly-buried remains of my conception,
the child of my once-enjoyèd toil and foolish machinations,
myself a cursèd goddess of a Sisyphean name—

Yet, as the sediment yields,
once-mightier stones abused by the waves
now huddled in their collectively futile resistance,
I find myself equally fated:

It's not a sand castle else.

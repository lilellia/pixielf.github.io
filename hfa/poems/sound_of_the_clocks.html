    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            Tick, tock. Tick, tock.<br/>
            How that one constant sound reminds me that I exist,<br/>
            yet it is no human that makes that noise.<br/>
            For one would lower themselves to focus only on<br/>
            this inscrutable passage of time over any of the endless<br/>
            fascinations which may entice them.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Nay, not "inscrutable", for the passage of time is<br/>
            so concrete, so tangible,<br/>
            that often, it is the only thing I can perceive,<br/>
            the rest of the world a meaningless blur<br/>
            upon which my eyes refuse to focus.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet, the clock must exist. Time must go one.<br/>
            But something must drive the clock,<br/>
            for it cares not on its own that time should pass around it.<br/>
            Yet, no one remembers the clock<br/>
            except when it is convenient.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Should the clock e'er stop,<br/>
            its purpose is, for it, impossible to achieve.<br/>
            To them, time may fail occasionally to exist,<br/>
            even if they think they know it doesn't.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet, I know the clocks,<br/>
            how unfair it might be for them,<br/>
            so incognizant of even that idea.<br/>
            But I am she who focuses here.

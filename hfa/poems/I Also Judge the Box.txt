TITLE: I Also Judge the Box
ID: i-also-judge-the-box

My gaze turned, I yet cannot but watch,
so acutely aware of the glass wall between us,
a bloodied handprint on one side,
its owner so desperate to escape its bounds.
I feel trickles of her jealousy—liberty, her prey.

Yet, the encaging walls stand,
what must be enchanted defenses
`gainst her unparalled efforts.

An actress, then, she is: on stage,
where she must hide her true intents
in order to play a newfound role.

Yet, still within the glass is she,
observèd only in part:
no voice, no screams, no flailing moves—
No actress, then, but mime.

Yet, for all the eyes upon her box,
no mouth could say her name
for only I know her charade.

Yet, no one could e'er hear me say—
My voice, contained, the same.

TITLE: Conflict of Interest
ID: conflict-of-interest


It's there again—this emptiness in my chest,
this feeling of suffocating under the weight of the void,
this urge to curl up and sleep forever,
this craving to do anything—nothing—to feel differently.

    "Hey."

Anything—except talk to you.
It'd help, of course. It always does.
Until it makes it worse, that is—
Until I realize that I've taken too much of your time,
that I've fed off your energy,
that I've dragged you down with me.
And no one deserves that.

    "Are you okay?"

No. No, I'm not but
I don't want you to care—
I can't let you waste your time—
I—

No. No, I'm not, but
I don't know what to do—
I can't bring myself to hurt you—
I—

No. No, I'm not, and
I can't do this alone—
I—

I crave a touch, anything
that reminds me that I'm alive.
Yet... I put on my best fake smile.

    "I'm fine."

You're not convinced, but
you let it go for now.

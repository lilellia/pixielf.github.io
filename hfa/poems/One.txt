My chest is hollow—
My heartbeats rattles against my ribs,
an instrument whose music panics
at the thought of being heard.

Yet the concert looms, without
real time, real will to call it off,
for e'en the slowest should be quick
to say I asked for it.

And so will, amongst the noise,
ring out trebling octaves, their kaleidoscopic voice
too deaf to know that I should not
too early find myself among the fortuned few.

Yet the concert looms, without
real time, real will to call it off,
for e'en I know well that infinity
can be made of only the smallest zeros.

And so will, amongst the noise,
ring out trebling octaves, their kaleidoscopic voice
of a single hope of future performances
but that they might only need this one.

There's Nothing, like the lightning's spark
is nothing like the many raindrops' splash.
The lightning breeds a longer, slower, bestial roar
that, perhaps, cannot cross the sky to me.

Yet humanity has conquered this spark,
enslaving it to its own devaulation—
Perhaps, then, it's the same for me:
that another creature of light should be the object.

And so I, with weighted steps,
embrace the chaos of the rain,
far calmer than the lightning's fear—
perhaps that's enough for me:

A flood comprises nothing but raindrops, after all.

TITLE: [MC-5Y] An Infinite Landscape
ID: an-infinite-landscape


I sit alone, alone in this world
with just my thoughts for company.
I question what misfortune I must have
in order to endure this meager existence.

Sitting in class, the seconds tick by—
Agonizingly slowly.
My imagination runs wild, thoughts blurring together
in a chaos of ambient, indistinct hues:
Blue, then orange, then lavender, then blue again.

Exploring that inferno beyond the brilliant skies
or the horror-filled darkness that might surround me—

Class ends, jolting me from my reveries,
Collapsing that eternity into a moment.
Disoriented with my thoughts in disarray,
I'm forced back into reality.

But I do not despair,
for it is but a minor setback,
and soon enough, I will return to that world.
The path to it, once shrouded from my view,
is now clear.

I've taken the first step,
and I hear the one that follows.
I'm alone no longer after
this extraordinary gift.

This experience is quite novel,
but I do not shy away.
Her quiet words now guide me
through this newfound world of fantasy.

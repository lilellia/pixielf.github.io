TITLE: I Pray a Goddess's Power Might...

Two blinding streams of fire rush onward,
a duel between seasoned magicians:
rivals, perhaps, of the same clan.

The blazes act as forces opposed,
obeying diligently the third of Newton's laws
with a certain quantum ambiguity
that only I may know.

Two equilibria may themselves establish,
diametrically opposed:
one stable, the other chaotic,
where deviations multiply incorrigibly,
no longer recognizable.

I gingerly step between the flames,
a shield against their burning heats.
The magicians both speak their apologies
for my suffering, only marginally their fault.

What I alone can see is the truth
behind the blue-green flame:
Justified as they might be,
I am equally their intended target.

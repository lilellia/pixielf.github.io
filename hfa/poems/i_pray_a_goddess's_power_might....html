    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            Two blinding streams of fire rush onward,<br/>
            a duel between seasoned magicians:<br/>
            rivals, perhaps, of the same clan.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            The blazes act as forces opposed,<br/>
            obeying diligently the third of Newton's laws<br/>
            with a certain quantum ambiguity <br/>
            that only I may know.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Two equilibria may themselves establish,<br/>
            diametrically opposed:<br/>
            one stable, the other chaotic,<br/>
            where deviations multiply incorrigibly,<br/>
            no longer recognizable.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I gingerly step between the flames,<br/>
            a shield against their burning heats.<br/>
            The magicians both speak their apologies<br/>
            for my suffering, only marginally their fault.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            What I alone can see is the truth<br/>
            behind the blue-green flame:<br/>
            Justified as they might be,<br/>
            I am equally their intended target.
        </p>

    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            I hear the winds' gentle breeze outside my window.<br/>
            I see the tree branches swaying lazily.<br/>
            Kids in the nearby park fly kites against the blue skies,<br/>
            And part of me wants to join them.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I close my eyes.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I hear the winds' stronger gusts rattle against my skull.<br/>
            I see the tree branches crashing wildly.<br/>
            The sky darkens, the near-blue clarity now full of clouds.<br/>
            It looks like it might rain.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            The winds grow stronger, howling now.<br/>
            The branches groan and creak under the weight of the winds.<br/>
            These sounds overwhelm my mind, and it's all I can hear.<br/>
            The sky darkens... darkens... darkens... until its just cloudsâ€”<br/>
            The sun hid long ago.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Are those kids still there?<br/>
            Their kites won't last in these winds.<br/>
            Are those kids still there?<br/>
            I certainly don't want to join them.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I open my eyes.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            The sun shines.
        </p>

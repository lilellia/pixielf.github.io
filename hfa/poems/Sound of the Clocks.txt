TITLE: Sound of the Clocks
ID: sound-of-the-clocks

Tick, tock. Tick, tock.
How that one constant sound reminds me that I exist,
yet it is no human that makes that noise.
For one would lower themselves to focus only on
this inscrutable passage of time over any of the endless
fascinations which may entice them.

Nay, not "inscrutable", for the passage of time is
so concrete, so tangible,
that often, it is the only thing I can perceive,
the rest of the world a meaningless blur
upon which my eyes refuse to focus.

Yet, the clock must exist. Time must go on.
But something must drive the clock,
for it cares not on its own that time should pass around it.
Yet, no one remembers the clock
except when it is convenient.

Should the clock e'er stop,
its purpose is, for it, impossible to achieve.
To them, time may fail occasionally to exist,
even if they think they know it doesn't.

Yet, I know the clocks,
how unfair it might be for them,
so incognizant of even that idea.
But I am she who focuses here.

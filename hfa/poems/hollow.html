    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            Your words echo through my brain<br/>
            like through the empty space between the snow-capped mountains,<br/>
            like they'll cause the fated avalanche to begin.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your words echo through my brain<br/>
            until I could, from memory, recite them all,<br/>
            until you've long forgotten their existence.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your words echo through my brain,<br/>
            your thoughts usurping mine,<br/>
            your promises loud within my ears.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your words echo through my brain<br/>
            yet echo not through yours.
        </p>
    </div>

TITLE: Flicker
ID: flicker



The surrounding darkness encroaches,
swallowing me whole,
leaving nothing for me to experience
but its oppression—
the fear, hopelessness, isolation—

Yet still the flame erupts,
chasing the retreating void,
for nothing so abyssally empty can coexist
with something so immeasurably overflowing.

Yet even as the flames poach the evil night,
it can be no fast friend
as its mere touch is an evil greater still—
An enemy cast of my only ally.

Yet the ravaging flame,
eternal in its lust for fuel,
cannot but extinguish itself
as it consumes from the inside,
leaving me in a sea of darkness
far blacker 'gainst the newly-removèd light.

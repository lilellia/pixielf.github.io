            This, along with all of the poems whose names start with brackets, are taken from my time as one of the writers for a mod of <i>Doki Doki Literature Club</i> a few years ago. In particular, I served as the lead writer for both Sayori's and Monika's routes as well as the lead poem writer (and lead programmer, but that's less relevant). The mod was designed to fit the game more typically into the romance visual novel genre and, as such, give Monika a normal characterization. The other characters' backstories were also fleshed out.
        </p>

        <p>
            While I ended up writing a total of 19 poems for this project (4 each for Sayori, Monika, Yuri, and the player character and 3 for Natsuki), only some of them are preserved here. These were all an interesting challenge: the four girls would write four poems over the course of the game, and they all write about their own character conflicts in such a way that the later poems are more clear, forward, and candid about their conflicts. As an example, Yuri's first poem, <i>Fading Light</i>, uses the image of her staying up all night reading to rather innocently show her isolationist tendencies, desire to use books as an escape, and accordant loneliness. <i>Afterimage</i>, however, as her fourth poem, showcases her conflict most strongly, and—for this one in particular—serves as a vague manifestation of her backstory. Another fun challenge for this set was that, while the poems themselves were not shown in the original game, the titles of the girls' fourth poems were shown along with a brief description of the poems through narration, which I used to actually create those poems.

            Normally, the <i>DDLC</i> player would play a mini-game in order to write their own poems. However, I thought it'd be a cool idea for the player character to rewrite their fourth poem after the events of the weekend leading up to the school festival where they were going to share their poems, and they would rewrite it in a way that more strongly connects to the girl whose route the player is on. The poem mini-game features a list of 200 words, each assigned a score for each girl. I'd changed the gameplay for the fourth iteration so that the player could only choose words associated with the routed girl. Regardless, the player ends up choosing 20 words from the list (forming the poem), and these fifth poems—the ones I wrote—actually do, in fact, use 20 words associated with the chosen girl. In this particular case, for Yuri, I had the following 49 words: <i>afterimage, agonizing, ambient, analysis, atone, bookworm, brilliant, classy, courteous, covet, culture, dark, defeat, demise, despise, disarray, disoriented, effulgent, entropy, essence, eternity, existence, extraordinary, fantasy, heavensent, horror, imagination, incongruent, infallible, inferno, infinite, inquisitive, intellectual, landscape, lavender, literature, lust, massacre, meager, melancholy, misfortune, nature, nightgown, novel, polite, quiet, shy, study, tragedy</i>

            There's... a lot to unpack here. Definitely go read the poem first. I promise, this explanation will work a lot better without spoilers. Done? Cool.

        <p>
            The poem as a whole is designed to do two opposing things simultaneously. On the one hand, a naïve or surface reading sees the poem supporting a positive, optimistic, congratulatory mood and interpretation. On the other hand... well, it's actually the opposite:

                These are Miki Sayaka's final words in the anime <i>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</i>, and they also serve as the title of the episode in which they're spoken¹. Based on my knowledge of the scene, as well as my very limited Japanese, I'm not sure I've ever seen a perfectly faithful translation because the depth is hard to encapsulate, but Crunchyroll translates it as "I was stupid... so stupid."
            </p>

            <p>
                In particular, she was "so stupid" to believe that
                <ol>
                    <li>having her wish granted would make her happy — It doesn't. In becoming a magical girl, one makes a contract with Kyubey, who grants a wish in return. So, Sayaka trades her soul² and becomes a magical girl in order to cure the boy she has a crush on (who was in an accident and lost use of his arm, making it impossible for the prodigy to play the violin). Despite being unable to tell him the truth, she hopes that it will enable them to date, but he just ends up dating another girl instead. This realization helps to accelerate her realization that what she wants is to be recognized for her actions and that she's not nearly as selfless as she thinks she is.</li>

                    <li>she'll be able to make a difference as a magical girl — She doesn't. As an idealist³, she conflicts with Homura and Kyoko, and tells them that she will fight for people, not for herself. Combined with the reveal of the dark nature of the powers of the magical girl (see ²), she drives herself way~ too far, pushes her best friend away for casting doubt on her methods (while not being a magical girl herself), refuses help from Homura, and ultimately ends up driving herself to death. By the end (which isn't even that long since becoming a magical girl, she tells Kyouko that she "can't even remember what [she] thought was so important, so worth protecting..."</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
                ²The reveal of this fact, how the magical girls work, etc. is obviously a big part of the show, so it's fairly spread out, but these two sections are probably the best I can find:

                This is a fragment of one of Madoka's lines from her character song¹ (also from Madoka Magica), which also serves as the ending theme for episodes 1 and 2. In particular, the fragment is translated as "...but I'm lying". On the whole, the song sounds pretty cute and innocent, and the lyrics don't scream out as being anything more than a bit sad, but knowing the full story, this song hits really hard.

            </p>

            <p>
                Specifically, Homura is alluding to the fact that she's been reliving the past month (thanks to her time magic) close to 100 times for the sole purpose of trying to save Madoka from her fate, which... never ends up working. She sees Madoka as her only real friend, but Homura's the only one who can remember the other timelines. The irony (and falsity) of Madoka's promise to "never forget" Homura hits her hard, breaking her generally distant, aloof appearance.

            The overall structure of the poem is set up so that knowing a couple references (which, apart from Google Translating the title, I don't expect anyone to notice) entirely changes the tone: while the poem itself seems a celebration of the small promises and gestures made by our friends, the two Japanese titles, the line <i>All these beautiful promises</i>, and the line <i>Reminders of what such kindness may bring forth</i> are all designed to corrupt this interpretation. The poem's actual point is about how meaningless or even detrimental or painful promises can be since they can (and perhaps even often) come across as hollow or simply are broken. The counterintuitive nature of this claim is also supported by the poem's counterintuitive structure in the truth being hidden.

            This is Monika's third poem. As her lead route writer (specifically, I did the writing; my cowriter was the one who came up with most of the ideas and did the proofreading), I was one of the ones who had the most leverage in determining what Monika's new character was going to look like in the mod, and that included what her new conflict was going to be. I ended up largely basing her off of a combination of my high-school self, as well as characters Pyrrha Nikos and Weiss Schnee from <i>RWBY</i>. This poem is a nod to that inspiration, as it borrows heavily from the shared similarities between Monika and Pyrrha. In fact, "Do you believe in destiny?" are <a href="https://youtu.be/hq1lk-QWxNg?t=565">Pyrrha's last words</a>, moments before her death. As it pertains to this poem, Monika's conflict was about how she's seen as leagues above everyone else, even when (A) she's actually not that much better, and (B) it's simply because she has high expectations put upon her, so she puts in a lot of effort to improve.

            This was a drop-in replacement for Yuri's second poem in the original game: <a href="https://doki-doki-literature-club.fandom.com/wiki/Yuri/Poems#The_Raccoon">The Raccoon</a>. There, the imagery is more subtle, but it's also a clear discussion of her struggles with self-harm. A small detail that's not even remotely important is that "The Point of a Sword" is the English title for the first episode of the anime <i>Toji no Miko</i>. There, the title is referring to the purpose of a sword (and the French translation is <i>The Way Designated by a Sword</i>), but I always found the title hilarious, so it got a nod here.

            The poem's title is a reference to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbSA9TqjUn8">a scene</a> in Dragon Age: Inquisition where the player is set to proclaim judgment against her (dead) enemy due to some bureaucracy. Choosing the exasperated and sarcastic responses in annoyance that such a duty is required results in her saying this line, which I've also always found hilarious.

            Two of my roommates last year—my two best friends—had a big falling out, and I was constantly put in the middle of them. [E]'s introverted and spent most of her time in her room or would go back to her parents' house for the weekend, so I was really the only one who ever interacted with her, but that also meant that when [S] would complain to me about her, it always fell to me to defend [E] because (1) she's my friend, (2) she wasn't there to defend herself, and (3) [S] just really doesn't understand [E] at all, even though she thinks she does. And given [E]'s situation, I was the person she'd come to complain to about [S], so I played a lot of emotional support for both of them in their conflict against each other, which was always awkward because, well... I was in the middle of my two best friends who really don't like each other.

            So, when the speaker says that "I am equally their intended target", the point wasn't that I am the target as <b>much</b> as they are, but that they are targets just as <b>little</b> as I am. Though, this poem was written last fall, and the situation progressed a lot since then, so that's not exactly true anymore.

            This was also a commission of sorts. One of my friends—a music major—was tasked with taking a poem and writing it into a song, and she asked if she could use one of mine for the assignment. You might notice that I don't typically write a lot of lyric poetry, but I realized that I'd never written anything about my transition and offered to put something together that she could use. So, she got this one, which is one reason why it's so much more "Emily Dickinson" than I would normally write.

            This one might be my favorite. Early 2018 was really the first time I was writing any poetry at all, and those <i>DDLC</i> mod poems were a fun challenge between the different styles I had to try to match and the constraints I set myself. But I think <i>Mirror</i> is the first one that I wrote "on my own", and it was the start of me using poetry as a sort of coping strategy. <i>Afterimage</i> aside, most of the poems I write aren't always obnoxiously cryptic, but I definitely prefer having a layer of abstraction between the actual context and what's written on the page, and that stems from the fact that they're mostly focused on/inspired by things which I find difficult to talk about candidly. But, finding an image or metaphor that works to convey what I want, then putting in the effort to write it means that the poem can express things that I wouldn't be able to otherwise, so I've found it helpful as both a "get it off my chest" kind of thing as well as a productive distraction, which often helps pull me out of the worst of the emotional rut.

            The context to this one is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewsGmhAjjjI">aphantasia</a>, a psychological condition wherein one struggles (or is entirely unable) to mentally actualize sensory information—technically, just sight, but the term is used more broadly to encompass any combination of senses. The name gives rise to the antonymic "aphantom" in the poem, as well as the title being a cross between "nonsense" and "no sense". (For what it's worth, on the linked video's scale, I'd rate myself about a 2-3 for vision/sound, 1 for smell/touch/taste).

            I think that "One, Part One" and "One, Part Two" are really fun titles that I couldn't resist using. Either way, I'd met someone online, and February 7th was our first (and, it turns out, only) date. I thought it'd be cool to write a before-and-after of that experience. The title is a combination of it being the <i>first</i> date I'd ever been on and the possibility/"goal" that they might be "the <i>one</i>".

            淋しい (<i>samishii</i>) is a Japanese word used to express loneliness or a desire to meet with someone. Since then, I've heard it used in much more innocent contexts, but I originally came across the word on a web page talking about different ways to express "I miss you". There, 淋しい is listed as (paraphrased) "I'm lonely because you're not here, and it's not okay". In particular, there's a choice for the kanji—寂しい vs. 淋しい—and the site listed the second of these as slightly more grave. But, again, I've seen the word used a lot more freely than that, as a much more general "I'm lonely", so make of that what you will.

            Good luck making sense of this one given that it's not a language you'll find in Google Translate. As mentioned in my <a href="#mirror-context"><i>Mirror</i> comment</a>, I'm a fan of draping a layer of intrigue over something that I'm too shy/embarrassed/uncomfortable talking about, and languages are one of my favorite strategies for that, usually for a meta "the fact that I'm saying a thing that I know you can't understand is the point because I need to express it without you actually understanding" kind of thing. There's a certain level of that here.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you want some grammar hints to try to make heads or tails of the poem on your own:
            <ul>
                <li><i>arí</i> = 1s nominative, <i>arèl</i> = 2s nominative</li>

                <li><i>ékl—</i> = nominative → accusative marker for personal pronouns (i.e., <i>éklarí</i> = 1s acc.)</li>

                <li><i>st—</i> = nominative → dative marker for personal pronouns (i.e., <i>starí</i> = 1s dat.)</li>

                <li><i>ís X</i> = marks "X" as direct object (though <i>ís + ari = éklarí,</i> etc.)</li>

                <li><i>lí Y</i> = marks "Y" as indirect object (though <i>lí + ari = starí,</i> etc.)</li>

                <li><i>sí X</i> = attributive marker: regardless of its part of speech (though usu. noun/adj.), "X" functions as an adjective whose attribute is being given to whichever object is relevant</li>

                <li><i>bý</i> = "to be" (verbs don't conjugate). Combining this with the previous point, <i>X sí Y bý</i> = "X is [like, of similar to, embodying, etc.] Y."</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>

            Ah, back to the <i>DDLC</i> poems. This one is Monika's fourth poem, the title taken again from the original game. This one borrows heavily from Monika's other inspiration, RWBY's Weiss Schnee, the daughter/heiress of the CEO of the world's largest company and whose story is centered around her escaping the expectations placed upon her, and in her own words, claiming her life as hers and saying that "We all have to carve out our own way".

            This one was inspired by <i>RWBY</i> a bit more directly. In the show, there's a creature known as <a href="https://rwby.fandom.com/wiki/Apathy">The Apathy</a>, terrifying monsters who suck out people's will to live. After the episode in Volume 6 where they showed up aired, one of the show's writers shared a bit of the <a href="https://twitter.com/TheMilesLuna/status/1071453149427322880?s=20">story of how they came to be</a>, which I used as an inspiration for this poem.

            If Yuri's conflict was about anxiety and PTSD and struggling with self harm, and Monika's was about finding her own place in the world and gaining control over her life, Sayori's conflict was struggling with suicidal depression. She's the type whom you wouldn't immediately expect to be depressed because she's always the one who's most energetic and excited and will cheer you up in a heartbeat, but it's all a shell. "Favorite" isn't the right word, but the part of the original game I'll always appreciate the most is how Sayori's depression confession is handled. Unlike in most media, the way she talks and thinks about it feels so refreshingly genuine… if extraordinarily painful, and I think that, especially with the game's popularity, it helped people to understand the condition. In fact, when it came for me to write Sayori's depression confession scene, I mostly just adapted the original scene instead.

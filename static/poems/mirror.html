    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            There's something about the way she looks at me,<br/>
            her vacant expression peering from blue-gray eyes<br/>
            that house a world of uniform overcast,<br/>
            a world of skies who promise<br/>
            neither the gentle joy of the sun<br/>
            nor the feral anger of the storm.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Her unkempt hair falls lazily and chaotically<br/>
            around her shoulders, framing her visage<br/>
            quite unlike any portrait she'd commission.<br/>
            Yet the world has rendered it for her, free of chargeâ€”<br/>
            a gift she didn't ask for, a gift she didn't want.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I can feel her chest tighten<br/>
            as her breath quickens<br/>
            and shallows,<br/>
            as her heart beats quietly<br/>
            against its oft rediscovered cage.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            We stare a long time into each other's eyes,<br/>
            neither of us daring to move,<br/>
            but this isn't the amorous abyss I've heard exists<br/>
            in your real-world faerie tales.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead, it's merely a mirror.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            I sit motionless, blankly watching<br/>
            as the blackness behind my closèd eyes<br/>
            remains unchanged, still black<br/>
            as they send their imaginations into overdrive—<br/>
            blacker yet<br/>
            than the night while Selene sleeps upon her duty,<br/>
            than the loneliest ocean depths not even the anglerfish dare haunt,<br/>
            than the black hole's horizons of hundred-trillion Pascal pressures<br/>
            that match not the one I feel to fill this void—<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            It is childish to believe in ghosts:<br/>
            I do not feel the phantom touch upon my shoulder<br/>
            where she not long ago placed her hand,<br/>
            where she not log ago sent a pulse through my nerves,<br/>
            a such aphantom touch<br/>
            that one might suspect my heart its epicenter;<br/>
            yet, its present shimmer of a forgotten oasis<br/>
            in this desert of indistinguishable smoothness<br/>
            cannot satisfy this thirst I cannot even express.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            So blessèd to drink are they.
        </p>

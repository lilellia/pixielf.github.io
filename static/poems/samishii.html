        <p>
            Each bird does fly with its own wings,<br/>
            nor would they wish to share,<br/>
            so one is last, by math's own hand,<br/>
            yet the bird seems not to care.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            The birdling stays within its nest.<br/>
            There, watching from below,<br/>
            loudly she claims, her friends unblamed:<br/>
            It hurts not to be slow.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            The other birds, alighting down,<br/>
            speak oft of their long flights.<br/>
            Our little birdling listens long,<br/>
            listens throughout the night.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            She knows full well that she'd the same,<br/>
            their roles, by magic, made reversed.<br/>
            Were she the one to chase her dreams,<br/>
            her voice would squeal in verse.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Each bird foes fly with its own wings<br/>
            and fly on its own pace.<br/>
            For some, alas, a pace minute:<br/>
            It's a truth which she must face.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            And so she dreams, her dreams held high,<br/>
            but anxious yet is she.<br/>
            Each story told, she asks herself,<br/>
            "What if that's not for me?"<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Their stories echo through the trees,<br/>
            and though she feigns like joy,<br/>
            their stories echo `gainst her skull,<br/>
            her brain those sounds' mere toy.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Ironic, then, amidst their crowd,<br/>
            she's left to feel alone.<br/>
            She dreams and dreams to match their acts,<br/>
            her world as cold as stone.
        </p>

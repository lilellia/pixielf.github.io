    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            I hear what must be my voice,<br/>
            fluttering almost imperceptibly aloud—<br/>
            desperately withheld—<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I hear your voice: it calls to me, loud,<br/>
            as the waterfall crashing against my back,<br/>
            as I struggle to breathe under its aquatic weight.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            You ironically echo my once-unreciprocated thoughts—<br/>
            begging to change mind, pronouns reversed.<br/>
            Jealous pity escapes me—<br/>
            criss-crossed threads of contradiction<br/>
            in the heart I wear on my sleeve.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            It is no magic forcefield which repels us,<br/>
            nor are me magnets of the same pole—<br/>
            but that I selfishly pull away in disappointment<br/>
            before I should cower in your shame.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I know you chase a certain hope,<br/>
            believed it could be me—what I<br/>
            believed unrequited thoughts,<br/>
            echoing painfully against my skull.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I feel you flinch before I've opened my mouth,<br/>
            expectant of my mapped response.<br/>
            Yet, you hold your tongue, knowing, too,<br/>
            this pained regret in my voice.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Unambiguously trembling<br/>
            as words quiver outward<br/>
            of what must be their own accord—<br/>
            It pounds strongly in my head,<br/>
            battering nearly equally to your waterfall<br/>
            which bears no secret behind its roar<br/>
            but a certain, fatedly inhuman crack.
        </p>

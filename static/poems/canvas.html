    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            The nighttime sky is a canvas,<br/>
            written on by the gods,<br/>
            the stars' white ink pooling in their poetry<br/>
            until Apollo brings the sun.<br/>
            And so it was that nature's authors wrote their works<br/>
            above the heads of man.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I dreamed, once,<br/>
            that I could see how it all ends,<br/>
            the fate of the world written all on the pages at my fingertips<br/>
            if I could only make out the words.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            But the more I stared,<br/>
            the more the pages faded away.<br/>
            What I wouldn't give to know their words,<br/>
            to know if things might get better,<br/>
            if hope is worth the risk,<br/>
            if I should even try.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            You say we write our feelings and our dreams<br/>
            onto the unstructured, unjudging void,<br/>
            that it's true that it bears me no good will,<br/>
            nor does it bear a grudge.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            The fluid sky has no strength, no memory, no shame.<br/>
            It isn't the solid, unchanging, heartless stone, after all.
        </p>

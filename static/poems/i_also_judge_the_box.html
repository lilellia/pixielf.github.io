    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            My gaze turned, I yet cannot but watch,<br/>
            so acutely aware of the glass wall between us,<br/>
            a bloodied handprint on one side,<br/>
            its owner so desperate to escape its bounds.<br/>
            I feel trickles of her jealousy—liberty, her prey.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet, the encaging walls stand,<br/>
            what must be enchanted defenses<br/>
            `gainst her unparalled efforts.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            An actress, then, she is: on stage,<br/>
            where she must hide her true intents<br/>
            in order to play a newfound role.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet, still within the glass is she,<br/>
            observèd only in part:<br/>
            no voice, no screams, no flailing moves—<br/>
            No actress, then, but mime.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet, for all the eyes upon her box,<br/>
            no mouth could say her name<br/>
            for only I know her charade.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet, no one could e'er hear me say—<br/>
            My voice, contained, the same.
        </p>

                My chest is hollow—<br/>
                My heartbeats rattles against my ribs,<br/>
                an instrument whose music panics<br/>
                at the thought of being heard.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet the concert looms, without<br/>
                real time, real will to call it off,<br/>
                for e'en the slowest should be quick<br/>
                to say I asked for it.
            </p>
            <p>
                And so will, amongst the noise,<br/>
                ring out trebling octaves, their kaleidoscopic voice<br/>
                too deaf to know that I should not<br/>
                too early find myself among the fortuned few.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet the concert looms, without<br/>
                real time, real will to call it off,<br/>
                for e'en I know well that infinity<br/>
                can be made of only the smallest zeros.
            </p>

            <p>
                And so will, amongst the noise,<br/>
                ring out trebling octaves, their kaleidoscopic voice<br/>
                of a single hope of future performances<br/>
                but that they might only need this one.

                There's Nothing, like the lightning's spark<br/>
                is nothing like the many raindrops' splash.<br/>
                The lightning breeds a longer, slower, bestial roar<br/>
                that, perhaps, cannot cross the sky to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet humanity has conquered this spark,<br/>
                enslaving it to its own devaluation—<br/>
                Perhaps, then, it's the same for me:<br/>
                that another creature of light should be the object.
            </p>
            <p>
                And so I, with weighted steps,<br/>
                embrace the chaos of the rain,<br/>
                far calmer than the lightning's fear—<br/>
                perhaps that's enough for me:
            </p>
            <p>
                A flood comprises nothing but raindrops, after all.

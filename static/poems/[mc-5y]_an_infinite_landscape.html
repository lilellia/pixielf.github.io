    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            I sit alone, alone in this world<br/>
            with just my thoughts for company.<br/>
            I question what misfortune I must have<br/>
            in order to endure this meager existence.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sitting in class, the seconds tick by—<br/>
            Agonizingly slowly.<br/>
            My imagination runs wild, thoughts blurring together<br/>
            in a chaos of ambient, indistinct hues:<br/>
            Blue, then orange, then lavender, then blue again.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Exploring that inferno beyond the brilliant skies<br/>
            or the horror-filled darkness that might surround me—<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Class ends, jolting me from my reveries,<br/>
            Collapsing that eternity into a moment.<br/>
            Disoriented with my thoughts in disarray,<br/>
            I'm forced back into reality.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            But I do not despair,<br/>
            for it is but a minor setback,<br/>
            and soon enough, I will return to that world.<br/>
            The path to it, once shrouded from my view,<br/>
            is now clear.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I've taken the first step,<br/>
            and I hear the one that follows.<br/>
            I'm alone no longer after<br/>
            this extraordinary gift.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            This experience is quite novel,<br/>
            but I do not shy away.<br/>
            Her quiet words now guide me<br/>
            through this newfound world of fantasy.

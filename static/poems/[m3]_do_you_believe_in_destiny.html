    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            Your first attempt at anything<br/>
            Is going to be subpar.<br/>
            Set the bar a little lower,<br/>
            Start with something small.<br/>
            Climb up there, step by step.<br/>
            Ready, go! Again, again!<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            You think that you can't do this,<br/>
            That this comes naturally.<br/>
            I'm telling you: you can,<br/>
            But you don't listen when I speak.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            It's only that I've done the work<br/>
            That let me get this far.<br/>
            Please don't judge me just for thatâ€”<br/>
            When you do, it breaks my heart.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            You've placed me on a pedestal<br/>
            (Which I don't think is right).<br/>
            And, because you've distanced me,<br/>
            Real friends are hard to find.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you knew me for who I am,<br/>
            You'd see that I'm in reach.<br/>
            But... Maybe it's just my destiny<br/>
            That you don't see me for me.
        </p>

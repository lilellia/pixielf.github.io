    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            It's there again—this emptiness in my chest,<br/>
            this feeling of suffocating under the weight of the void,<br/>
            this urge to curl up and sleep forever,<br/>
            this craving to do anything—nothing—to feel differently.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;"Hey."<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Anything—except talk to you.<br/>
            It'd help, of course. It always does.<br/>
            Until it makes it worse, that is—<br/>
            Until I realize that I've taken too much of your time,<br/>
            that I've fed off your energy,<br/>
            that I've dragged you down with me.<br/>
            And no one deserves that.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;"Are you okay?"<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            No. No, I'm not but<br/>
            I don't want you to care—<br/>
            I can't let you waste your time—<br/>
            I—<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            No. No, I'm not, but<br/>
            I don't know what to do—<br/>
            I can't bring myself to hurt you—<br/>
            I—<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            No. No, I'm not, and<br/>
            I can't do this alone—<br/>
            I—<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I crave a touch, anything<br/>
            that reminds me that I'm alive.<br/>
            Yet... I put on my best fake smile.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'm fine."<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            You're not convinced, but<br/>
            you let it go for now.
        </p>
